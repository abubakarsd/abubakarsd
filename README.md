 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I've always been fascinated by technology and how things work, and that curiosity led me to pursue a degree in computer science. During my first year in school, I started to develop a passion for coding, and I was eager to learn everything I could about the programming world.
During that time, I developed Jarvis, a personal PC assistant, which sparked my interest in AI and machine learning. I wanted to learn more about these fields, and I started experimenting with an Android simulator to see what I could create.
Since then, my passion for coding has only grown stronger, and I've honed my skills in a variety of programming languages, including C#, Django, React.js, Java, and PHP. I've also become proficient in AJAX, graphic design, and UI/UX design.
Over the years, I've worked on numerous projects, including e-commerce websites with multiple vendors, school management systems, and inventory systems with POS capabilities. I take pride in creating high-quality, user-friendly solutions that meet clients' needs and exceed their expectations.
In my free time, I enjoy attending industry events to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology and network with like-minded professionals. I am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skills and give back to the coding community.
